            Shelter follows the story of Rin &lt;<i>Reen&gt;</i>, a teenage girl who lives out her life&nbsp;inside a virtual reality. Equipped with a drawing tablet, Rin&nbsp;draws the world around her each day. In actuality, Shelter is set in a post-apocalyptic world where a planet collides with the Earth, destroying it and causing the death of the human race. However, Rin's father builds a spaceship and puts the child Rin into it, launching her into space and saving her life. Throughout the course of Shelter, Rin starts to remember everything that happened and the virtual world around her becomes a cruel mirror, showing Rin the events that led to where she is now.
